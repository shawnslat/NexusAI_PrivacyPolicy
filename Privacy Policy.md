## Introduction

Nexus Core Brief ("we", "us", "the App") respects your privacy. This app aggregates publicly available data from free sources (GDELT, HouseStockWatcher, FRED, public RSS feeds, etc.).

---

## 1. Information We Collect

- We collect minimal data — most information stays on your device.
- Optional push notifications are stored encrypted on your device only.
- Anonymous usage stats (app opens, crashes) may be collected — no personal identifiers.
- We do NOT sell, share, or transmit your data to third-party brokers or advertisers.

---

## 2. Location Data

- We may request optional coarse location (city-level only) for local features (e.g., local news, nearby events).
- Data is processed on-device, never transmitted, shared, or sold to third parties.
- You can disable or manually set location at any time via device settings or in-app ZIP code entry.
- We do not track your movements or location history.

## 3. Minimal Data Collection

- No personal data leaves your device unless explicitly shared by you.

## 4. How We Use Information

- Solely to deliver real-time public data and optional alerts.
- No sharing with third parties except as required by law.

## 5. AI Chat Feature (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key)

If you choose to use the optional AI chat feature:

- **Your API Key**: You provide your own API key from a third-party AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, or custom endpoint).
- **Key Storage**: Your API key is encrypted and stored on your device only.
- **Direct Communication**: Your API key is sent directly from your device to your chosen AI provider — we never see, store, or access it.
- **Third-Party Processing**: Conversations are processed by your chosen AI provider according to their privacy policy.
